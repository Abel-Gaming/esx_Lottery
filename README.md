# San Andreas Lotto
<hr>

## Want to give your players a chance to win big??
With the esx_Lottery script your players now can gamble their money away with the San Andreas Lotto! Server owners can change many things in the config to configure it to their liking! Best of all, it's free!

We have been wanting this for a long time in our server; however, I could never find a script that I was content with, so, I created our own. Figured I would share it with you all in case someone else is looking for something similar of what I wanted.
